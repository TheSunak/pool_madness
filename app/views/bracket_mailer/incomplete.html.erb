<p>Hello <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>
  Looks like you started a bracket but some of the picks are absent or the tiebreaker score is missing. Just a reminder
  that all brackets must be completed and paid for by tip off tomorrow (Noon EST). All unpaid or incomplete brackets
  <b>will be deleted at tip off tomorrow</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Just head to your <%= link_to 'bracket detail page', bracket_url(@bracket) %> and finish filling out your bracket.
  Tournament starts tomorrow!
</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>
