    <h1>Types of Payment</h1>

  <p>
    Each bracket entry in the pool has a $10 entry fee. The options are described in detail below.
  </p>
  <p>
    These methods assume trust that the proverbial "check is in the mail". We're all friends here. Filling out
    a bracket assumes you've agreed to pay the entry fee before the tournament starts. In some circumstances that's not
    possible. Therefore, <strong>if you need extra time you must make arrangements with a pool administrator</strong>.
    Failure to make good on the arrangement will result in removal of the bracket from the pool and potential ban from
    future pools.

  <h2>Cash</h2>
  <p>
    Cash in person is by far the easiest option. Note that because of lack of payment by some entries last year,
    <strong>you must pay an admin in person before tip off or your entry will be voided.</strong>

    We accept all major credit cards. Note, the processing company charges us $0.61 per bracket which we add to the
    amount charged. Just select "Pay with Credit Card" on <%= link_to "your brackets", brackets_path %> page.
